18. How to we select an element? Example - every h2 on the page
	To select an element in CSS, simply write out the tag name before your curly braces; all elements identified with that tag in your HTML will be selected. (ex. p {color:blue} will turn all paragraph text blue, unless specifically defined elsewhere).

	A class attribute is used to group elements together to assign style rules to many elements all at once (as with paragraphs across a webpage, that you want uniform formatting across).

	There is no confirmation prompt or warning, and items are permanently deleted.

34. Why should I use version control? 
	It is the best way to collaborate	with other developers - you are able to maintain the original code, while branching off and simultaneously completing tasks that can later be pushed and merged back into a single working product. It helps to minimize bugs and keep track of when, who, and how fixes are made. Bugs are more easily addressed due to the tracking process, and the main, master code is always maintained in case of emergencies.

35. How often should I commit to github?
	As often as possible (within reasonable limits, of course)! Smaller, more frequent pushes minimize the risk of pushing bugs to the main repo, and they also make it easier to track down issues. Ideal frequency will depend on the number of collaborators, and the frequency of your actual changes, but ultimately you will want to push very frequently (so long as you check your work and make sure you aren't stepping on your colleagues' toes).

36. What is the command we would use to push our repo up to github? 
	git push -u origin branch-name

37. Walk me through Lambda's git flow. 
- Fork the repo on GitHub
- Clone the forked repo to your device by entering the following command into your device terminal (you will need the SSH URL for the repo, available on GitHub): git clone <URL>
- In your terminal, move into the cloned repo using the following command (it is a relative command, so you will need to move in file sequence - use "pwd" to help with this step): cd <filename you want to move into>
- In your terminal, create a branch using the following command: git checkout -b <branch-name>
- Open your project in VSCode using the following command in your terminal: code .  (If this does not work, you may need to open VSCode manually and navigate to your project files)
- Make changes to the project!
- Use the following command to check that your changes are coming through successfully: git status
- Stage your changes using the following command: git add . (or to stage specific files individually, use git add <filename> )
- Use the following command to check that your staged files are coming through successfully: git status
- Commit your changes and add a commit message to let other devs know what your change was and how you you did it using the following command: git commit -m '<Your public commit message here>'
- Push your change to the remote branch for your project using the following: git push -u origin <branch name>
- Return to GitHub and make a pull request

Stretch Questions

1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
	An inline element does not start a new line and only takes up as much space as it needs. A block element, however, does start a new line and always occupies the full width of the line.

2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
	Absolutely positioned elements disregard all other elements on the page and will always maintain their specified position - relatively positioned elements, by contrast, take into account the flow of the page and surrounding elements, and position themselves accordingly.

3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
	Use Flexbox! You can set limits for expansion that allow fluidity of the elements within your parameters.

4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
	Display block by default: 1. div 2. paragraph 3. address 
	Display inline by default: 1. anchor 2. span 
	Display inline-block by default: button

5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
	The box model refers to the space around your content; you have your actual content (like an image or block of text) visible on the screen, then you have padding around your content that gives it room to breath, then you may have a border around that padding, then a margin that clears space between other content and your border. This "box" defines the spacing around your content and between it and other elements on the page.
	You are able to define these properties of the box model in CSS - every element in HTML can have these properties defined, and in that way you maintain complete control of your content and how it interacts with everything on your webpage.
